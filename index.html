    <p class="text-pendidikan">I studied at the University of Muhammadiyah North Sumatra (UMSU), majoring in Information Technology. During my studies, I studied various important aspects of technology, from programming, computer networks, system security, to artificial intelligence and embedded systems. My main focus was on the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics-based systems, where I actively participated in various practical projects and research that deepened my understanding of the application of technology in real life.

        The academic environment at UMSU gave me the opportunity to develop technical skills and critical thinking, as well as foster a collaborative spirit in solving various technological challenges. With the support of lecturers and adequate laboratory facilities, I was able to hone my skills in designing intelligent systems and innovating independently and in teams.</p>

    <p class="keahlian">Currently, I am also expanding my expertise in web development. I started learning how to build websites, starting from the basics such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to modern frameworks such as React. My goal is to develop interactive web interfaces that can be directly connected to robotics systems, such as sensor monitoring dashboards, web-based robot controls, and real-time IoT integration. By combining my expertise in robotics and web development, I want to create more holistic and integrated technology solutions.</p>
